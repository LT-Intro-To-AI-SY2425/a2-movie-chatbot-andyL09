# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.



## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg     - DONE
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process        - DONE
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`        - DONE
4. Complete the reflection problems below       - DONE
5. Push your code to github for grading     - DONE

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?  
The whole excersise was pretty difficult for me.  There
were a lot of new concepts that i was seeing for the
first time.  It was pretty intresting and fun to learn
though.  It seems to help me if i go through the code
first and take notes and or make some kind of flow chart
diagram to see how it works before i start working on
it.  Not doing that makes things a bit more confusing and
harder to see how everything connects.  


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.
You could use the match function by giving it a input and
then parsing the input.  Once you have the input parsed
you can compare it to all of the saved lists of strings
in the database and then you will be able to tell which
list of strings it matches best.
